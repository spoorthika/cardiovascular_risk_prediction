Here we are going to see about cardiovascular risk prediction ,the developed machine learning model represents a significant advancement in cardiovascular risk prediction, enabling proactive interventions and personalized care plans. Leveraging algorithms like Random Forest, the model effectively predicts the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), despite challenges such as data quality issues and interpretability concerns. Collaboration between stakeholders is essential for further refinement and innovation, ensuring the model's relevance and effectiveness in real-world healthcare settings. Accurate risk prediction serves as a cornerstone of preventive healthcare efforts, facilitating early identification and management of CHD risk factors. Future research should focus on refining model performance, enhancing interpretability, and integrating the model seamlessly into clinical workflows. The model's implementation underscores its potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize resource allocation, and foster healthier communities. By empowering individuals to make informed lifestyle choices and seek timely medical care, accurate risk prediction contributes to proactive health management and enhanced quality of life.![image](https://github.com/spoorthika/cardiovascular_risk_prediction/assets/154603932/f8235590-ce43-4046-a218-807ff3f13feb)
